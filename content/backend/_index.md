{{< callout type="warning" >}}
On it's own this bot doesn't do anything, you of course need to also at least be running the DTTT [base addon](https://github.com/Discord-for-TTT2/dttt).  
Documentation for which can be found here:  
[Docs]({{< ref "dttt" >}})
{{< /callout >}}

In order for DTTT to interact with Discord you need some sort of backend.
But if you don't know how to code, don't worry! We've got you covered.

This page will go over our own project: [dttt-backend](https://github.com/Discord-for-TTT2/dttt-backend)

If you want to build your own, you should use this reference [API]({{< ref "http" >}}).
