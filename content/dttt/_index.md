In order for this addon to work, you need to run some sort of backend to receive HTTP requests.
An example project can be found here:
https://github.com/vertiKarl/Hahnrich-Discord/blob/master/src/TTTMuter/TTTMuter.ts

A simple standalone version is planned.

To build your own, use this reference [API]({{< ref "http" >}}).
